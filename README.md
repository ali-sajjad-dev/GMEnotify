# GMEnotify

 I Built an inventory notification bot that sends an SMS when the Sony Playstation 5 console is in-stock on Gamestop.com in Python.
 
 I Implemented 2 web scrapers. The first to generate an open-source proxy list and utilize it for IP rotation, along with 
 randomized User-Agent headers to bypass web scraping blockers. The second web scraper to gather inventory info and
 parse the HTML via beautifulsoup4. 

 Programmed the SMS capability via Twilioâ€™s API
